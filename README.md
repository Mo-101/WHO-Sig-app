## Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variable to be set in your Vercel project:

- `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Your Mapbox access token (get one free at [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com))

**Important:** This variable should be set as a **server-side only** environment variable (without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix) for security. Add this variable in the **Vars** section of the v0 sidebar or in your Vercel project settings.
